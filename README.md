# Memory Game for Udacity FEND

## Description

This is a memory game for my Udacity FEND Nano-Degree. I created this game using
the skills I have learned using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and jQuery).

This game is fully responsive.

The Guidelines for this game can be found here:
[ Memory Game project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view).

## Contributing

I used the starter code provided by Udacity which included most of the HTML, some CSS, and the shuffle function in JavaScript.

I found how to do the modal using
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp) instructions.

I also received help on several occasions from my fantastic peers who are taking
this Udacity Nano-Degree alongside me.

#### Enjoy!
